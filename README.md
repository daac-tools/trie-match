This macro speeds up Rust's `match` expression for comparing strings by using a
compact double-array data structure.

## Usage

Simply wrap the existing `match` expression with the `trie_match! {}` macro as
follows:

```rust
use trie_match::trie_match;

let x = "abd";

trie_match! {
    match x {
        "a" => { println!("x"); }
        "abc" => { println!("y"); }
        "abd" | "bcc" => { println!("z"); }
        "bc" => { println!("w"); }
        _ => { println!(" "); }
    }
}
```

## Why is it faster?

In a normal `match` expression, the string is compared for each pattern. It is
equivalent to the following code:

```rust
if x == "a" {
    ..
} else if x == "abc" {
    ..
} else if x == "abd" || x == "bcc" {
    ..
} else if x == "bc" {
    ..
} else {
    ..
}
```

The above code requires that string comparisons be made from the beginning of
the string each time. The time complexity of the above code is *O(mn)*, where
*m* is the average pattern length, and *n* is the number of patterns.

In contrast, this macro builds the following trie structure to retrieve the
index of the matched arm:

Furthermore, this implementation uses the compact double-array data structure
to achieve efficient state-to-state traversal, and the time complexity becomes
*O(m)*.

## `cfg` attribute

Only when using Nightly Rust, this macro supports conditional compilation with
the `cfg` attribute. To use this feature, enable `features = ["cfg_attribute"]`
in your `Cargo.toml`.

### Example

```rust
trie_match! {
    match x {
        #[cfg(feature = "foo")]
        "a" => { .. }
        #[cfg(feature = "bar")]
        "b" => { .. }
        _ => { .. }
    }
}
```

## Limitations

The followings are different from the normal `match` expression:

* Only supports strings, byte strings, and u8 slices as patterns.
* The wildcard is evaluated last. (The normal `match` expression does not
  match patterns after the wildcard.)
* Pattern bindings are unavailable.
* Guards are unavailable.

Sometimes the normal `match` expression is faster, depending on how
optimization is performed, so it is better to choose based on your speed
experiments.

## Benchmark

Run the following command:

```
cargo bench
```
